        INGREDIENTS
        <ol>
            <li>250 gr beans</li> 
            <li>1 Ripe plantains</li>
            <li>1 onion bulbs</li>
            <li>2 tablespoonful ground crayfish</li>
            <li>1 stock cube</li>
            <li>1 spoonful Cooking Red palm oil</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper</li>
        </ol>
    </div>
    <div class="div2">
        DIRECTIONS
        <ol>
            <li>First, soak the beans in cold water for about 3 hours or overnight. Discard the water, rinse the beans, and strain in a
            colander or strainer. Tip: if you want this meal in a jiffy, skip the soaking and cook the beans with 1/5 teaspoon
            baking soda.</li>
            <li>Cut the plantains, peel off the skin, cut into chunks, and set aside.</li>
            <li>Grind the crayfish. Chop the onions and pepper and set aside.</li>
            <li>Place the strained beans in a pot or pressure cooker, pour in some water, to about an inch above the level of the beans. Then leave to cook until tender, but not too soft. You might need to add more water, but be careful not to add to much to avoid having a watery porridge.</li>
            <li>Now add the onions and peeled plantains to the pot. Cook until the plantains are tender.</li>
            <li>Add the crayfish, stock cubes, palm oil, salt and pepper to taste. Mix thoroughly and leave to simmer for 8 to 10
            minutes on a low heat. Your Beans and Plantain Porridge is now ready.</li>
            <li>You can eat it as it is or topped with tomato stew, or simply serve with bread.</li>
        </ol>
