            <p>The surreal, swooping rock valleys of Cappadocia are every photographer's dream.
            
            Cliff ridges and hill crests are home to rippling panoramas of wave-like rock or wacky-shaped pinnacles that have been
            formed by millennia of wind and water action.</p>

            <p>
            Sumptuous beyond belief, Istanbul's Topkapı Palace takes you into the fantastical, opulent world of the sultans. <br>
            
            It was from here, during the 15th and 16th centuries, that the sultans of the Ottoman era carved out an empire that
            would extend up into Europe and down through the Middle East and into Africa.

            <p>This weird and lonely place has to be one of Turkey's most peculiar archaeological sites. The giant stone heads of
            long-forgotten gods stare out from the summit, casting an eerie atmosphere over the barren mountaintop.</p>
