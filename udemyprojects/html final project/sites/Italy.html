            <summary>Hike the Cinque Terre</summary>
            <p>For spectacular views, picturesque villages, wild open landscapes and local experiences, it's hard to beat the five
            towns of Italy's Cinque Terre and the cliff path that connects them. <br>
            The 12-kilometer Sentiero Azzurro stretches from
            Monterosso to Riomaggiore, but it's conveniently broken into segments that you can hike from one town to the next,
            returning or moving on by train.</p>

            <summary>Glide through Venice in a Gondola</summary>
            <p>It may be Venice's number one cliché, but drifting along a canal in the graceful curve of a gondola is one of the top
            things to do in Italy. Finding a gondolier is easy. 
            They gather along the Grand Canal by the Doge's Palace and at Rialto
            Bridge, and you'll see them in their striped shirts and straw hats on bridges and canals as you explore the city.</p>

            <summary>Tour Tuscan Hill Towns by Bicycle or Car</summary>
            <p>Tuscany's hilly countryside is best enjoyed at leisure, stopping to explore tiny settlements between the tourist
            attractions of the larger medieval towns that crown the hilltops. While a driving tour can cover more of these towns, a
            bicycle gets you closer to the land and gives you time to notice more details.</p>

            pasta. Pasta and other cooking classes are offered throughout Italy, but Florence has a number of them, often combined

            <summary>Tour Lake Como by Boat</summary>
            <p>The most beautiful lake in Italy's Lake District, Como is surrounded by steep mountain slopes covered in lush greenery
            and dotted with compact towns and magnificent villas.
            <br>
            Since Roman times, it has drawn royalty and aristocrats to its lovely shores. A tour of the lake on the lake steamers
            that act as passenger ferries between towns, as you pass the stunning villas and manicured gardens that surround them,
            is definitely one of the top things to do in Italy.</p>
