                complex that very few are able to rival.

            <summary> Toledo (Provincia de Toledo)</summary>
            <p>Playing key notes in the development of the city of Toledo, located 44 miles (73 km) south of Madrid, are a number of
            religions, including Christianity, Islam, and Judaism. Surrounded by the Tagus River, and sitting atop a hill, this city
            along with its 2-millennia of history, is charmingly complex, and it will take far longer than a quick weekend trip to
            do it justice.</p>
